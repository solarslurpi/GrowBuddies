        value is provided, an exception is raised.

        """get_callbacks() returns a dictionary of callback methods to be called by the
        :py:meth:`growbuddies.mqtt_code.MQTTClient.on_message`. For example, the
        growbudies_settings.json file contains several callback dictionaries. Here is the
        callback dictionary for SnifferBuddy:

        .. code:: json

            {
            "snifferbuddy_mqtt": {
                "tele/snifferbuddy/SENSOR": "on_snifferbuddy_readings",

                }
            }

        The dictionary states for the key "snifferBuddy_mqtt", when a message is received on the topic
        "tele/snifferbuddy/SENSOR", the method on_snifferbuddy_readings() is to be called.  When a
        message is received on the topic "tele/snifferbuddy/LWT", the method on_snifferbuddy_status() is to be called.

        Typically, this method is called prior to instantiating an instance of the
        :py:class:`growbuddies.mqtt_code.MQTTService` class. For example, the following code instantiates
        an instance of the MQTTService class and passes the callbacks dictionary to the MQTTService class:

        .. code-block:: python

            settings = Settings()
            settings.load()
            callbacks = Callbacks()
            methods = settings.get_callbacks("snifferbuddy_mqtt", callbacks)
            mqtt_service = MQTTService(methods)
            mqtt_service.start()

        Args:
            key (str): Key to the method names in the instance_to_callbacks_class instance that are to be called
            when a message is received on the topic associated with the key.  In the above example, the caller has
            written the two callback methods, :on_snifferbuddy_readings() and on_snifferbuddy_status().

            instance_to_callbacks_class (class instance): Instance of the class that contains the callback methods.

        Returns:
            dict (dict): A dictionary of callback methods to be called by :py:class:`growbuddies.mqtt_code.MQTTService`.
            The dictionary is keyed by the topic and the value is the callback method to be called.
