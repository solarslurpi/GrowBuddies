# Welcome to GrowBuddies! {material-regular}`yard;2em;sd-text-success`
Hello, fellow indoor gardeners!

The GrowBuddies project is designed to help geeky gardeners like us maximize the health and enjoyment of our indoor gardens.

Current activities include:
- Monitoring atmospheric conditions including CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity.
