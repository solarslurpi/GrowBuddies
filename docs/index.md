# Welcome to GrowBuddy!

GrowBuddy is an Open DIY project that monitors and adjusts environment variables that affect plant growth within a grow tent.  Currently, GrowBuddy focuses on controlling an indoor plant's water needs.  Helping plants get the right amount of water - whether the water is in the form of vapor when in the air or liquid in the soil - is difficult to get right.  Besides, watering requires constant - usually daily - attention.  How does that work when I want to go on vacation?  Since I grow in Living Soil (I recommend [KIS BioChar](https://www.kisorganics.com/products/kis-organics-biochar-soil-mix)), GrowBuddy's solutions focus on growing in soil, but of course aren't constrained to soil based grows.
## Current Solutions
The current solutions (given the focus is on water) are:
- [Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)](VPDbuddy.md)
- [Soil Moisture](SoilMoistureBuddy.md)


Everyone is welcome. I am a care giver to plants.  Five months out of the year, I grow outdoors.  The rest of the time I grow indoors.  It amazes me how much happiness there can be gained by taking care of plants. I find doing programming and hardware projects a wonderful hobby.  I also love learning and it seems to me there is A LOT I can learn.  So [Contact me](mailto:happygrowbuddy@gmail.com) with thoughts, questions, interests.

Once the water needs are dialed in, other areas that will be explored to automate include:
- adjusting the CO2 level to maxima level of CO2 that is higher than is in the air ( TODO ).
- distance light is from canopy based on PPFD ( TODO )
- nutrition deficits ( TODO )
- pest probems ( TODO )
- virus probems ( TODO )
- 3D Printed Microscope to view microbes ( TODO )
- TBD
