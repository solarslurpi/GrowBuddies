## Looking Real




Everyone is welcome. I am a care giver to plants.  Five months out of the year, I grow outdoors.  The rest of the time I grow indoors.  It amazes me how much happiness there can be gained by taking care of plants. I find doing programming and hardware projects a wonderful hobby.  I also love learning and it seems to me there is A LOT I can learn.  So [Contact me](mailto:happygrowBuddy@gmail.com) with thoughts, questions, interests.

Once the water needs are dialed in, other areas that will be explored to automate include:
- adjusting the CO2 level to maxima level of CO2 that is higher than is in the air ( TODO ).
- distance light is from canopy based on PPFD ( TODO )
- nutrition deficits ( TODO )
- pest probems ( TODO )
- virus probems ( TODO )
- 3D Printed Microscope to view microbes ( TODO )
- TBD
