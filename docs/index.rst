=====================
Welcome to GrowBuddy!
=====================
GrowBuddy is a DIY "smart gardening" environment where it's technology helps us maintain:

- the humidity / temperature in an ideal range (see VPD for more information).
- a living soil bed at the ideal soil moisture (see Living Soil for more information).
- a level of CO2 that is higher than is in the air ( TODO ).
- TBD

and helps with diagnosing:

- nutrition deficits ( TODO )
- pest probems ( TODO )
- virus probems ( TODO )
- TBD


The TBDs indicate that this project evolves as we learn more.  Please let me know what you think, especially what can be improved.

I am a care giver to plants.  Five months out of the year, I grow outdoors.  The rest of the time I grow indoors.  It amazes me how much happiness 
is gained by being a care taker to plants.
