=====================
Welcome to GrowBuddy!
=====================
GrowBuddy is a DIY "smart gardening" environment cobbled together with inexpensive hardware, 3D printed enclosures, software, and wifi to help us maintain:

- the humidity / temperature in an ideal range (see VPD for more information).
- a living soil bed at the ideal soil moisture (see Living Soil for more information).
- a level of CO2 that is higher than is in the air ( TODO ).
- TBD

and helps with diagnosing:

- nutrition deficits ( TODO )
- pest probems ( TODO )
- virus probems ( TODO )
- TBD


The TBDs indicate that this project will continually evolve and (hopefully!) improve.  Please let me know what you think, especially what can be improved.

You can reach me at happygrowbuddy@gmail.com

Everyone is welcome. Perhaps most especially if you are a care giver of plants with an appreciation of DIY technology.  I am a care giver to plants.  Five months out of the year, I grow outdoors.  The rest of the time I grow indoors.  It amazes me how much happiness 
is gained by being a care taker to plants.  

See you in the garden!
