# Overview

GrowBuddy monitors and adjusts environment variables that affect plant growth within a growtent.  It is a Open DIY project that encourages participation in order to continuously evolve GrowBuddy.  Currently, GrowBuddy focuses on controlling an indoor plant's water needs.  Helping plants get the right amount of water - whether the water is in the form of vapor when in the air or liquid in the soil, I have found getting the right amount of water at the right time to a plant is difficult to get right.  Besides, watering requires constant - usually daily - attention.  How does that work when I want to go on vacation?
