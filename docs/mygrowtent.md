# My Grow Tent
Welcome to my grow tent! A place to relax and smile.

## Living Soil
After watching soil microbes under a microscope, I became convinced Living Soil is the way to go.  The next decision was individual containers, or a bed of soil.  I opted for the bed of soil.  This way, the roots, soil, and microbes have a vast expanse to thrive in.  The con for me was having a significant amount of soil in my kitchen.  I hope to be using the same soil for 5 years.  We'll see about that!

My soil of choice is [KIS Organic's BIOCHAR](https://www.kisorganics.com/products/kis-organics-biochar-soil-mix).  The folks at KIS Organics truly care about the quality of their product as well as the quality of our grows.  Besides, [Tad and team are at the forefront of plant research as well as providing us with quality growing content](https://www.kisorganics.com/pages/learn-1).

## Dimensions
The dimensions of the grow tent is roughly 5'L x 1.5'W x 15"H, 0.35 total yards or about 71 gallons.  


## End of June, 2022 Grow
After the plants have been removed, I sent a soil sample to Logan Labs (phone: 937-842-6100, email: office@loganlabs.com).  For $55, they ran a Mehlich III ( [soil report](https://github.com/solarslurpi/GrowBuddy/blob/70419ae3411059a7b3b08b6d992fbf19b6a8a788/external_docs/soil_report_Logan_Labs_6_30_2022.pdfr) ) test and a [Saturated Paste test](https://github.com/solarslurpi/GrowBuddy/blob/70419ae3411059a7b3b08b6d992fbf19b6a8a788/external_docs/paste_report_Logan_Labs_6_30_2022.pdf).

Because I bought my [Living Soil from KIS Organics](https://www.kisorganics.com/products/kis-organics-biochar-soil-mix), Brandon - an amazingly awesome person who REALLY knows about growing in Living Soil - interpreted the lab results, noting:
```
Mehlich III:
pH is starting to climb out of the sweet spot (6.8-6.9) but I would not take any action unless it continues to climb. You can always pH down your irrigation source to 6.8 if you want to make a small adjustment. If it continues to climb we can add elemental sulfur.

Phosphorus is very low at 661. I would recommend 7 cups of bone meal and 3 cups of soft rock phosphate per yard (201.9 gallons of soil-if you need help with your soil volume let me know). I would also keep an eye on the Paste test P metric after you get your amendments in. Once you have sufficient P on the Mehlich III monitor the Paste Test  for sufficiency 2-4 ppm. If it is low after adding the bone and soft rock you might consider running Mammoth P or some other phosphorus solubilizing bacteria. 

Cations look great but we will base decisions on the Paste Test.

Sodium is starting to get high at 104. Keep an eye on it going forward. 

We discussed the high aluminum number. Sometimes this is a testing anomaly. I would hold off on adding any of your compost for now and we will keep an eye on this next round. 

Ammonium is perfect

Nitrate is very low, around 50 pounds per acre. If you are planning a two week veg I would want that number closer to 150 pounds per acre. You could add some feather meal or blood meal. If you add the bone as fishbone meal for your phosphorus this will bring in some N as well. If you went with the standard bovine bone meal for P I would add 2 cups feather meal per yard OR 10 cups alfalfa. If you need a metric for N based on a different input let me know. 

Paste test:

Sulfur is good for now- provides terpenes

P is low but we have already discussed

Cations look pretty great but I would add 2 cups of gypsum per yard. This will improve your balance and help calcium compete with Mg.

Do not add Mg for now. If you see lower leaf interveinal yellowing let me know. That is a clear Mg deficiency.

Add 1 cup per yard of potassium sulfate to bring your cations into a better balance. 
```
### Adding Back
Based on Brandon's advice, I'm adding:
- 7 cups of bone meal (bovine not fish) per yard. 7 x .35 = 2.45 cups
- 5 cups Soft rock phosphate per yard. 5 x .35 = 1.75 cups 
- 10 cups of alfalfa per yard. 10 x .35 = 3.5 cups
- 1 cup of potassium sulfate per yard. 1 x .35 = .35 cups (it is easier to add to water, pH and water in such a small amount)
