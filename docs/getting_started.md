# Getting Started
Let's start with the core components:
- [Build the GrowBuddy Server](growbuddyServer.md)
- [Build SnifferBuddy](snifferbuddy_page)
These are the two foundational components.  After these two Buddies are built, readings for the air temperature, relative humidity, CO2 level, vpd value, and light level readings are available and can be stored in an influxdb database.

Once these Buddies are built, move on to build [VPD Buddy](vpdbuddy).
