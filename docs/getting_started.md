# Getting Started
## Build The Core Components
Let's start with the core components:
- [Build the GrowBuddy Server](growbuddyServer.md)
- [Build SnifferBuddy](snifferbuddy_page)
-:doc:`Write Python to access SnifferBuddy readings]<..code/examples/snifferbuddy_simple.py>`
## Store SnifferBuddy Readings
Plug in the GrowBuddy Server and SnifferBuddy.  The GrowBuddy Server just needs to be in a position that it can participate in the home's wifi.  The SnifferBuddy should hang where you want to know the temperature, etc. of the air.
- Store Readings.  With this code, we can store not only the air readings from the SnifferBuddy sensor, but also the vpd calculated from the air and
- Graph SnifferBuddy Readings
## Build vpdBuddy
Once these Buddies are built, move on to build [VPD Buddy](vpdbuddy).
