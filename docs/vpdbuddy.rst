VPDBuddy works to make sure the `Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour-pressure_deficit>`_ is within an "ideal" range.  The source for the ideal range is the `Flu Cultivation Guide  <https://github.com/solarslurpi/GrowBuddy/blob/main/docs/FLU-CultivationGuide_Cannabis_WEB_PROOF_01-2020.pdf>`_ .  Figure 6 notes an ideal VPD range during the:

- vegetative state is 0.8 to 0.95
- flower state is 0.96 to 1.15

If the ideal VPD values are maintained during vegetative and flowering state, VPDBuddy is doing it's job!
