- Good 'ol [Gus](gus) has set up a listening "box" [aka the mosquitto mqtt broker](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt-works/) that holds the latest SnifferBuddy mqtt message.  If instructed to do so, Gus can store the SnifferBuddy readings in an influxdb database.  If the readings are stored, you no longer need Gus to access the readings.  For example, you can create simple to sophisticated dashboards using Grafana.  Or look at the data through apps that speak to influxdb's API.
